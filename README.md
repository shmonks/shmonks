# About me ğŸ‘‹

- Hi, I'm Sarah, and I've moved into product management after 15 years as a professor in the UK and Europe. I also moved 5,000 miles from London to California 2 years ago. Can you tell I like making bold decisions? ğŸ˜¬ ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡º ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on lots of things! But my new 'secret' weekend project is a new article about an early eighteenth-century monument in London to two women who loved each other, which I'm currently researching for a conference paper in July: https://henry-moore.org/discover-and-research/sculpture-research-programme/calls-for-papers/monuments-in-conversation-westminster-abbey-in-the-eighteenth-century/ 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SQL, Microsoft Power BI, Python... and GitHub! Also getting ready to take the PMP exam ğŸ˜±
