# About me ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on lots of things! But my new 'secret' weekend project is a new article about an early eighteenth-century monument in London to 2 women who loved each other, which I'm currently researching for a conference paper in July: https://henry-moore.org/discover-and-research/sculpture-research-programme/calls-for-papers/monuments-in-conversation-westminster-abbey-in-the-eighteenth-century/ 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SQL, Microsoft Power BI, Python... and GitHub!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about why art history is AAAALLLLLL about product
